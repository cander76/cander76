### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**cander76/cander76** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hello! My name is Caitlyn Anderson and I am currently a senior at Brigham Young University studying statistics! I created this profile and my blog for my Stat 386 class that I am currently taking. I hope to become proficient at Git, GitHub, Data Science Blogging, and Python!
